#Module 1 HTML CSS GIT: Code Refactoring Challenge

## Description

This week's challenge was an on-the-job ticket, which means we were provided a starter code to modify. One of the most common tasks that front end junior developers face
is refactoring meaning restructing the code provided without changing its functionality. Refactoring codes improves the design structure as well as readability while
reducing complexities and duplications. In this case the The modification was to address **accessibility**. 
"Ensuring websites are accessible and usable for everyone should be a primary concern for anyone who works within the online space"-Ruth Everett, Search Engine Journal (SEJ).
Having an accessible website allows all users: 
* Easily navigate the site
* Improve their experience
* To obtain the information or service they are looking for
As a result it is an important consideration for all businesses, especially when the coronavirus pandemic has incresed web usage manifold. The need for accessible 
websites as a result is indeed great. 

### What was done

* Semantic HTML elements were added wherever possible
* HTML codes follow a logical structure such as <header> <body> <footer> elements
* All Images and icons elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
